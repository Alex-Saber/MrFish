	* transitions from ??
	* transitions to attack2_right or idlecomb_right

	[7] -> idlecomb_right

attack2_right:

	* transitions from attack1_right
	* transitions to attack3_right or idlecomb_right
	* move player forward horizontally during the animation (implement in unity?)

	[0] -> [1] move the player forward a small amount
	[4] -> attack3_right
	[7] -> idlecomb_right

attack3_right:
	
	* transitions from attack2_right
	* transitions to idlecomb_right

	[7] -> idlecomb_right

LEFT----------------------------
